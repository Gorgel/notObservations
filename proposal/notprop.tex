\scijust{Dark matter was first termed in a paper from 1933 [ref] by Fritz
Zwicky. He used the virial theorem to calculate the gravitational mass of
the galaxies in the Coma cluster and found a discrepancy between the
measured mass and their expected luminosity. He referred to this
"missing mass" as "dunkle materie". Today astronomers have accumulated
convincing evidence of dark matter from independent observations such
as galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, measurements of
the cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations
, supernovae distance measurements, Lyman-alpha forest measurements 
of distant galaxies and in structure formation scenarios.
\par
According to the spectacularly successful Planck mission, the dark matter
part of the energy in the universe is a staggering 26.8\%
compared with the 4.9\% of ordinary matter. Even though the consensus among scientist
today is that dark matter consists of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles
(WIMPs), no official detections of these elusive particles have been made and
the hunt for these particles is one of the major undertakings of modern physics.
In what better way to make aspiring student of astronomy more comfortable
with observational instruments, than for them to "see" for
themselves what the "fuss" is all about? The reproducibility of science is
after all one of the fundamental pillars of science itself.
By the guidance of past and present mentors we therefore propose to use the
NOT telescope
to measure the rotation curve of NGC 5963, fit a light+dark mass profile 
to the acquired data and determine the stellar/dark matter mass components of
this galaxy. \\

\noindent \textbf{The need for a new observation and its selection:} The target in consideration, NGC 5963 is of the type Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxy (Romanishin, Strom \& Strom 1982 ApJ 252, 77) which are usual targets for dark matter studies due to their peculiar mass to light ratio. NGC 5963 is no exception to such studies (e.g. Bosma et al. 1988, A\& A 198, 100). However, the latest  direct observations of NGC 5963 we could find in the literature were taken over a decade ago (Simon et al. 2004 ASPC, 327, 18), which speaks for the acquisition of newer observations. 
\par
Another virtue of the selected target is that if photometric images of good enough quality of the galaxy is provided, they might give insight to its anomaly underluminous nature (Zackrisson et al. in preparation). NGC 5963 strongly deviates from the expected Tully-Fisher (TF) relation (Springob et al. 2007 ApJS, 172, 599) by being underluminous and/or having far greater non-baryonic mass than expected. Newer observations with the NOT may aid in uncovering why this is so.

%
% You also need to specify the Run ids (as defined in box 6) for which the

%%                       BACKUP PROGRAMME
%%
% For projects needing excellent image quality or photometric conditions, 
% give a short description of possible backup programme. A backup programme 
% is also needed in case an unfavourable wind speed or direction may prevent
% you from executing your main programme.    
%
% - If no backup programme is provided, justify why none is needed. Failure
%   to ensure that the telescope will be used productively under all 
%   circumstances will lower the rating of your proposal!
%
% - The instrumental setup for the backup programme should normally be the 
%   same as for the main programme; however, standby instrumentation (e.g. 
%   StanCam or FIES) may be used instead. Please specify the instrument you 
%   will use.
